# PicoCTF2021 - GET aHEAD

## Description
Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition [http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/)

## Solution
1. Inspected the source code of [view-source:http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/index.php](view-source:http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/index.php) and noticed that each colour corresponsd to a HTTP method.
2. Used Burp to intercept the request when changing background colour and used Repeater to modify requests
3. Referred to [MDN's HTTP request methods documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods), and tried ```HEAD``` an option (which was alluded to by the title of the challenge)
4. Replaced the HTTP method with ```HEAD``` in Repeater request and sent it which resulted in a response returning the flag
